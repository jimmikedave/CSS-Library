# Welcome to Jim's CSS-Library
This is my personal testing grounds for documenting CSS features such as flex, grid, and hover features.

## Initialize
### `npm install`
### `npm start`


This project was initialized with `npx create-react-app css-library`. After installing the react library I installed React Router to add navigation to the application, `npm install react-router`.

This application contains a central window that showcases different CSS styling methods learned in my Advanced CSS and Sass course, taught by Jonas Schmedtmann. His course dove deep into Float Layouts, Flexbox, Grid, and Animations. In this application you can navigate from page to page to view styling effects that were learned.
